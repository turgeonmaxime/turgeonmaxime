# Max Turgeon

I'm an Assistant Professor in the departments of [Statistics](https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/statistics/) and [Computer Science](https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/) at the University of Manitoba. My research focuses on dimension reduction methods for high-dimensional data, with a special interest for computationally and statistically efficient methods.

My main computational projects are `R` packages:
  - [`casebase`](http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/) for fitting smooth parametric hazards using case-base sampling.
  - [`pcev`](https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/pcev) implements *Principal Component of Explained Variance*, a dimension reduction method coupled with a hypothesis-testing framework for two multivariate datasets.
  - [`rootWishart`](https://github.com/turgeonmaxime/rootWishart) uses arbitrary-precision linear algebra to compute the distribution of the largest root of single and double Wishart problems.
